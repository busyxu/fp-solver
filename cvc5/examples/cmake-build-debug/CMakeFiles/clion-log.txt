  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cvc5" with any of
  the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "cvc5" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cvc5_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "cvc5"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
