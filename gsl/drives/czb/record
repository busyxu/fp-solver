Folders that are NOT our targets:

block, bspline(too complicated, maybe later), cheb (too simple), combination (too simple), const (too simple),
dht(too simple), err (too simple), fft (not very good, too long complex computations), fit (simple or small code),
rng(simple),

Record:

good candidate:
                                             folder
1. complex.c             2000 2000 10        complex
2. integration.c         2000 2000 10        integration
3. gsl_cdf_binomial_P.c  2000 2000 10        cdf
4. deriv_driver.c        2000 2000 10        deriv, diff (similar way)
5. gsl_sf_bessel_sin_pi4_e.c 5000 2000 10    special function
6. gsl_sf_bessel_I1_scaled_e_gsl 2000 2000 10  special function

maybe: needs parameter tuning

1. klee_gslSortVectorLargest.c
2. blas_driver.c (needs further inspection)


not good candidate:

1. gsl_poly_solve_quadratic_driver.c (complex condition in main path)
2. jacobi_driver_gsl.c (no hit for 5 minutes)
